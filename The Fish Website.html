	<p>There are many ways fish can be calssified </p>
	<p>Fish can be classified into fresh water fish and salt water fish</p>
	<h1>Salt water fish</h1>
	<p>They are found in salty waters ie Seas and Oceans</p>
	<h2>Examples of Salt Water Fish</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Tuna </li>
		<li>Salmon</li>
		<li>Mackerel</li>
		<li>Snapper</li>
		<li>Grouper</li>
		<li>Swordfish</li>
		<li>Marlin</li>
		<li>Anchovi</li>
		<li>Clownfish</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Salt water fish are also acalled marine fish</p>
	<h2>Key Charactersistics of salt water fish </h2>
	<h3>1.Osmoregulation</h3>
	<p>Marine Fish constantly loose water from their bodies so they drink salt water and excrete excess salt through specialised gills</p>
	<h3>2.Diverse habitats</h3>
	<p>Salt water fish can be found in these areas:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Coral Reefs </li>
		<li>Open Oceans</li>
		<li>Mangrooves </li>
		<li>Esttuaries</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>3.They havey bright colors and patterns</h3>
	<p>Salt water fish havebright colors and and patterns especially reef fish like clownfish and angelfish</p>
	<p>Their colos is esential for camoflage, mating or even warning predators </p>
	<h3>4.Adapted for salt water and depth </h3>
	<p>Deep sea species have special adaptations for extreme pressure, darkness and extreme pressure</p>
	<br>
	<br>


	<h1>Fresh Water Fish</h1>
	<p>Fresh water fish are found in fresh waters </p>
	<h2>Examples of fresh water fish</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Tilapia</li>
		<li>Catfish</li>
		<li>Bass</li>
		<li>Trout</li>
		<li>Carp</li>
		<li>Pikes</li>
		<li>Bluegill</li>
		<li>Perch</li>
		<li>Guppy</li>
		<li>Arowana</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Another name for fresh water fish is Inland Water Fish</p>
	<h2>Key Features of Fresh water Fish </h2>
	<h3>1.Osmaoregulation</h3>
	<p>Fresh Water fish absorb water constantly through their skin and gills, so they must excrete large amount of diluted urine to maintain balance.</p>
	<p>They actively absorb salts and minerals through their gills and also while feedding they get some salt in thir food</p>
	<h3>2.Habitat Diversity </h3>
	<p>Fresh water fish are found in all kinds of habitat from fast-flowing mountain streams to still warm ponds</p>
	<h3>3.Coloraion </h3>
	<p>Fresh water fish are often less colored compared to salt water fish, except for some species like Guppies or Cichlids due to the more muted environments </p>
	<h3>4.Reproduction </h3>
	<p>Many lay eggs in nests or vegetation, some, like livebearers (eg Guppies or Cichlids), give birth to live young ones.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


	<p>Fish can also be classified according to their sceletal structure</p>
	<p>Bony Fish and Cartilaginoous fish </p>

	<h1>Bony Fish </h1>
	<p>These are fish with hard bones in thir surface</p>
	<p>They are also called <p class="keyword">Osteichthyes</p></p>
	<h2>Examples of Bony Fish</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Tilapia </li>
		<li>Trout</li>
		<li>Tuna</li>
		<li>Clownfish</li>
		<li>Goldfish</li>
		<li>Anglersfish</li>
		<li>Lungfish</li>
		<li>Coelacanth</li>
	</ol>
	<h2>Key Charactersistics of Bony Fish</h2>
	<h3>1.Bony Skeleton</h3>
	<p>Their internal skeleton is made of true bone(not cartilage like in Sharks).</p>
	<h3>2.Swim Bladder </h3>
	<p>A gas-filled organ that helps control bouyancy, allowing them to float or sink without swimming constantly</p>
	<h3>3.Scales </h3>
	<p>They are covered in oerlaping cycloid or ctenoid scales that provide protection.</p>
	<h3>4.Gills that are covered by operculum </h3>
	<p>Unlike cartilaginous fish, bony fish have an operculum- a hard bony flap that protects thir gills.</p>
	<h3>5.Fins With Rays.</h3>
	<p>Most bony Fish have fins supported by flexible bony spines (rays)</p>
	<h3>6.Reproduction</h3>
	<p>Most bony fish are <p class="keyword">Oviparous</p> (lay eggs), but some give birth to live young </p>
	<h3>7.Diverse mouth position </h3>
	<p>Depending on how and where they feed, mouths may be upward-facing, foward-facing or downwrad-facing. </p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<h1>Cartilaginous fish</h1>
	<p>They are fish that have their skeletone made of cartilage, not bone.</p>
	<p>Cartilage is a soft, bedy material in your ear or in your nose</p>
	<p>Cartilaginous fish are usually strong swimmers and often predators </p>
	<h2>Examples of cartilaginous Fish</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Great White Shark</li>
		<li>Hammerhead Shak </li>
		<li>Tiger Shark </li>
		<li>Bull Shark</li>
		<li>Whale Shark</li>
		<li>Manta Ray </li>
		<li>Sting Ray </li>
		<li>Eagle Ray</li>
		<li>Thornback Skate </li>
		<li>Big Skate</li>
		<li>Rabit Fish</li>
		<li>Spotted Rat Fish</li>
	</ol>
	<h2>Some Key Charactersitics Of Cartilaginous Fish </h2>\
	<h3>1.Cartilage Skeletone </h3>
	<p>Their Skeletone is light and flexible. No Hard Bone</p>
	<h3>2.No True Bone </h3>
	<p>Their whole skeletone is cartilage </p>
	<h3>3.Gills </h3>
	<p>Their Gills is exposed with small gill slits (no operculum)</p>
	<h3>4.No Swim Bladder </h3>
	<p>They must sink in order to avoid sinking </p>
	<h3>5.Great Senses </h3>
	<p>They have great eyesight and smell, they can detect electrical signals from prey. This is what makes them great hunters </p>
	<h3>6.Reproduction </h3>
	<p>Some lay eggs while some give birth to live young ones </p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>Fish can also be classified according to their feeding habit</p>
	<p>While classifying fish in this manner there are three classes of fish:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Herbivorous</li>
		<li>Carnivorous Fish</li>
		<li>Omnivorous Fish</li>
	</ol>
	<h1>Herbivorous Fish</h1>
	<p>These are Fish that eat plants and Algae</p>
	<h2>Examples of Herbivorous Fish</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Parrotfish </li>
		<li>Surgeonfish </li>
		<li>Moorish Idol</li>
		<li>Tilapia</li>
		<li>Grass Crap</li>
		<li>Silver Dollar </li>
		<li>Siamese Algae Eater </li>
	</ol>
	<h2>Key Characteristics Of Herbivorous Fish </h2>
	<p>Here are some key characteristics of herbivorous fish:</p>
	<h3>1. Specialized Mouth Parts</h3>
	<p>They often have, broad teeth or beak-likke mouth to scrape or chew plants and algae.</p>
	<p>Some(Like Parrotfish) have fused teeth that help grind coral and scrape algae off rocks</p>
	<h3>2. Long Digestive Tract </h3>
	<P>Plant material is harder to digest than meat, so herbivorous fish have longer intestine to allow more time for digestion and nutrient absorption </P>
	<h3>3. Habitat Preference </h3>
	<p>They are found in places with abundant vegetation like: Coral reefs (Marine), Shalow lakes and rivers(freshwater).</p>
	<h3>4. Constant Eating Behaviour </h3>
	<p>They graze throughout the day, feeding on algae, leaves, and phytoplankton</p>
	<p>This condtant feeding helps control algae overgrowth and maintain ecosystem balance</p>
	<h3>5. Symbiotic Gut Microbes</h3>
	<p>Many herbivorous fish have gut bacteria that help break down gut bacteria(a plant fiber), adding digestion.</p>
	<h3>6. Non-Aggressive Nature</h3>
	<p>Most are non-predatory and show peaceful behaviour, especially in aquariums</p>
	<p>Their survival strategies are based more on avoidance than aggression </p>
	<h3>7. Ecological Role </h3>
	<p>They help: 
		-Controle algae on coral reefs and rocks
		-Cycle nutrients in freshwater ecosystem 
		-Support biodiversity by maintaining habitats 
	</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<h1>Carnivorous Fish </h1>
	<p>They feed on other fish/animals </p>
	<p>Carnivorous Fish are adopted to hunt, capture and digest other animals such as smaller fish, insects, crustaceans, and zooplankton.</p>
	<h2>Examples of Carnivorous Fish </h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Piranha</li>
		<li>Tigerfish</li>
		<li>Pike</li>
		<li>Snakehead</li>
		<li>Catfish</li>
		<li>Arowana </li>
	</ol>
	<h2>Key Characteristics of carnivorous fish </h2>
	<h3>1. Sharp, Pointed Teeth</h3>
	<p>Designed for gripping, tearing or cutting flesh </p>
	<p>Some like Piranha or Barracudas have razor sharp teeth for quick bites </p>
	<p>Others like groupers have large mouth to swallow prey whole </p>
	<h3>2. Short Digestive Tracts </h3>
	<p>Animal protein is esier to digest than plant matter </p>
	<p>Carnivorous fish have a shorter gut compared to other herbivores </p>
	<p>Their digestive system are optimized for quick nutrient absorption </p>
	<h3>3. Strong Hunting Instincts </h3>
	<p>Often active predators, using speed and stelth to hunt prey </p>
	<p>Some are ambush hunters (eg Anglerfish, Lionfish), waiting motionless for prey to aproach </p>
	<h3>4.Forward Facing Eyes </h3>
	<p>This improves depth perception for acurately targeting prey</p>
	<p>Helps them target moving target in water </p>
	<h3>5. Streamline Body </h3>
	<p>Many carnivorous fish like the Tuna or Barracuda have torpedo shaped body for fast swimming </p>
	<p>Speed and agility help them chase and capture prey effectively</p>
	<h3>6. Solitary or Territorial behaviour</h3>
	<p>Many canivorous fish are solitary hunters </p>
	<p>Some like certain sharks or pike are territorial and aggressive toword intruders </p>
